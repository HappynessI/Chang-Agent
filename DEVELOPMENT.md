# Development log

## 2026-07-17 — v0–v3 skeleton

- Added validated public/hidden state protocols and a strict JSON Action parser.
- Added GT-free reset/step, point/box dispatch, candidate-state rebuilding, Verifier
  feedback, finish handling, trajectory persistence, and history-best selection.
- Added pure NumPy instance extraction/matching as a deterministic adapter fallback.
- Added the modern Qwen3-VL-2B multimodal Adapter with explicit T1/T2/mask labels.
- Added SimpleClick and OmniOVCD/SAM3 adapter boundaries for isolated environments.
- Added a rule Verifier baseline, frozen-feature trainable head, and offline GT mask
  perturbation labels.
- Added CPU unit tests and a two-round synthetic smoke loop.

Validation performed with Python 3.10.20 / NumPy 1.26.4:

```text
12 unit tests passed
two-round trajectory smoke passed
SegAgent external prev_mask forwarding smoke passed
```

The model-level checks below are now validated with local weights. They are kept in
separate processes because SAM3 and SimpleClick use incompatible dependency stacks.

## 2026-07-17 — training/rollout/server smoke preparation

- Added a deterministic `train_verifier.py --smoke` path. It exercises the trainable
  head, quality/error-map/classification losses, optimizer update, checkpoint writing,
  and memory telemetry.
- Added `rollout_smoke.py`, which uses the real `OmniOVCDAdapter` boundary and mock
  tool callbacks to exercise two feedback-loop steps without GT.
- Added `SAM3ProcessorAdapter` for concrete `set_image`, `set_text_prompt`, and
  `add_geometric_prompt` integration, with a fake-processor regression test.
- Added `qwen3vl_smoke.py` and `download_qwen3vl.py`; the latter keeps model files
  under `models/`, outside the Git repository.
- Added `collect_runtime_manifest.py` and `configs/runtime_cpu.json` for reproducible
  local/server runs.

Smoke results on the current host:

```text
Verifier: 2 epochs, loss 5.3406 -> 5.3378, RSS ~630 MB, CUDA unavailable
Adapter rollout: 2 steps, RSS ~38 MB, CUDA unavailable
```

The current host reports no NVIDIA driver (`nvidia-smi` cannot communicate with the
driver), so real GPU VRAM and CUDA model generation remain pending. Qwen3-VL download
is being performed from the official Hugging Face endpoint in tmux; its completion
status and artifact path are recorded in `logs/qwen3vl_download_official.log`.

The local Qwen3-VL checkpoint subsequently downloaded successfully to
`/Data/wyh/CD-SegAgent/models/Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct` (4,255,140,312-byte
`model.safetensors`). The real CPU generation smoke passed:

```text
load_seconds: 5.115
RSS: 37.87 MB -> 981.57 MB (delta 943.70 MB)
raw JSON: {"target_view":"t1","action":"positive_point","coordinate":[500,100]}
parsed pixel coordinate: [32, 6]
transformers: 4.57.3
```

The smoke process reported a transient CUDA probe inconsistency (one process saw 8
devices, while an independent probe and `nvidia-smi` could not initialize NVML). Since
the run used `device_map=cpu` and allocated/reserved 0 MB VRAM, no GPU memory claim is
made until the server driver is healthy.

The Qwen3-VL-to-Environment rollout smoke also passed. The generated raw response was
accepted by the ActionParser, executed as an Environment step, and followed by a
Verifier-accepted `finish`; the trajectory was saved under
`/tmp/change_agent_qwen_rollout_smoke2/trajectory.json`. A single-GPU probe with
`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` currently reports no usable CUDA device, so no GPU was
allocated. When the driver is repaired, use one visible GPU and `device_map=auto` for
the same script; do not expose all GPUs for this smoke.

Real-weight adapter and Verifier checks:

```text
SAM3 text + geometric prompt (CPU): 50.949 s, peak RSS ~7,493 MB,
  models/sam3/sam3.pt, text masks 0, box masks 1
SimpleClick ViT-L external-mask point (CPU): 10.807 s, peak RSS ~3,124 MB,
  models/SimpleClick/cocolvis_vit_large.pth, output 256x256
LEVIR-CD verifier sample builder: 2 paired samples, 10 feature channels
LEVIR-CD verifier head: 1 epoch, loss 5.6379 -> 5.6904, peak RSS ~864 MB
```

The SAM3 and SimpleClick commands intentionally run independently; loading both
large checkpoints together is outside the bounded smoke-test memory budget. The
Qwen-to-Environment smoke remains the supported full Agent rollout, while the two
segmentation adapters are validated at their real model boundaries.
