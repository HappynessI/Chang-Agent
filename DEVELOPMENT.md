# Development log

## 2026-07-17 — v0–v3 skeleton

- Added validated public/hidden state protocols and a strict JSON Action parser.
- Added GT-free reset/step, point/box dispatch, candidate-state rebuilding, Verifier
  feedback, finish handling, trajectory persistence, and history-best selection.
- Added pure NumPy instance extraction/matching as a deterministic adapter fallback.
- Added the modern Qwen3-VL-2B multimodal Adapter with explicit T1/T2/mask labels.
- Added SimpleClick and OmniOVCD/SAM3 adapter boundaries for isolated environments.
- Added a rule Verifier baseline, frozen-feature trainable head, and offline GT mask
  perturbation labels.
- Added CPU unit tests and a two-round synthetic smoke loop.

Validation performed with Python 3.10.20 / NumPy 1.26.4:

```text
12 unit tests passed
two-round trajectory smoke passed
SegAgent external prev_mask forwarding smoke passed
```

Not yet validated: real Qwen3-VL generation, real OmniOVCD initialization, real SAM3
box prompting, real SimpleClick refinement quality, learned Verifier training, and
dataset-level metrics/ablations. These require the corresponding GPU environments and
weights.

## 2026-07-17 — training/rollout/server smoke preparation

- Added a deterministic `train_verifier.py --smoke` path. It exercises the trainable
  head, quality/error-map/classification losses, optimizer update, checkpoint writing,
  and memory telemetry.
- Added `rollout_smoke.py`, which uses the real `OmniOVCDAdapter` boundary and mock
  tool callbacks to exercise two feedback-loop steps without GT.
- Added `SAM3ProcessorAdapter` for concrete `set_image`, `set_text_prompt`, and
  `add_geometric_prompt` integration, with a fake-processor regression test.
- Added `qwen3vl_smoke.py` and `download_qwen3vl.py`; the latter keeps model files
  under `models/`, outside the Git repository.
- Added `collect_runtime_manifest.py` and `configs/runtime_cpu.json` for reproducible
  local/server runs.

Smoke results on the current host:

```text
Verifier: 2 epochs, loss 5.3406 -> 5.3378, RSS ~630 MB, CUDA unavailable
Adapter rollout: 2 steps, RSS ~38 MB, CUDA unavailable
```

The current host reports no NVIDIA driver (`nvidia-smi` cannot communicate with the
driver), so real GPU VRAM and CUDA model generation remain pending. Qwen3-VL download
is being performed from the official Hugging Face endpoint in tmux; its completion
status and artifact path are recorded in `logs/qwen3vl_download_official.log`.
